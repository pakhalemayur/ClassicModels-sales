# ClassicModels-sales
The classicmodels database is a retailer of scale models of classic cars. It contains typical business data, including information about customers, products, sales orders, sales order line items, and more.
A small company Axon, which is a retailer selling classic cars, is facing issues in managing and analyzing their sales data. The sales team is struggling to make sense of the data and they do not have a centralized system to manage and analyze the data. The management is unable to get accurate and up-to-date sales reports, which is affecting the decision-making process.

To address this issue, the company has decided to implement a Business Intelligence (BI) tool that can help them manage and analyze their sales data effectively. They have shortlisted Microsoft PowerBI and SQL as the BI tools for this project.

The goal of the capstone project is to design and implement a BI solution using PowerBI and SQL that can help the company manage and analyze their sales data effectively. The solution should be able to:

Import and integrate the data from MySQL database into PowerBi.

Clean and transform the data to make it ready for analysis.

Build interactive dashboards and reports using PowerBI that can help the sales team and management make sense of the data.

Use SQL to perform advanced analytics on the data and extract insights that can help the company improve its sales (if needed).

Enable the management to access the dashboards and reports in real-time and make data-driven decisions.
